What is Supra?

Supra is a powerful, cross-chain oracle that bridges real-world data with blockchains, enabling automation in a variety of sectors via highly secure and scalable smart contract interoperability. Supra also provides RNG services for provably fair automation of blockchain and Web3-based operations.

Oracles are crucial for blockchains to move forward in terms of interoperability with legacy systems as well as with one another. Smart contracts need to get off-chain and cross-chain data that’s fast, secure, scalable, and offers fast finality.  DeFi will need solutions like SupraOracles to fuel the next generation of crypto adoption and tokenization of the world’s off-chain assets.  

Ultimately, SupraOraclesth helps provide smart contracts the ability to push beyond their horizons with emergent use cases and business models, like dynamic NFTs and semi-fungible tokens. Get more details about Supra’s vision to revolutionize blockchain technology on our website.
